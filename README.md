# Hi there, I'm [Mohammad Mostafa Kawsar Rakib](https://yourwebsite.com) ðŸ‘‹

A tech-enthusiastic, accuracy-oriented and dedicated individual with a proactive approach and the crucial ability to operate both independently and in fast-paced team environments. I have outstanding problem solving skills with the ability to work with technical and abstract concepts efficiently. I enjoy the hunger of learning new technologies. I love to take new challenges because challenges make me more curious and proactive.

I'm very much passionate about web based applications specially in frontend development. I'm experienced in designing and developing interactive features to the web applications using JavaScript, React JS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Node JS, Express JS and MongoDB. I've also huge interest in ML and AI. That's why I learned and still learning more of Python. Here are some of the technologies and tools I've worked with:
